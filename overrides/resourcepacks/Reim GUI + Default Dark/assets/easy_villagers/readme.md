This mod lets you pick up villagers as an item.
There are also blocks that substitute every farm that includes villagers.
 
## The Villager Item

The villager item can be obtained by sneaking and right-clicking a villager or pressing the `V` key.

## The Trader Block

The trader block allows trading with the villager without having to deal with securing the villager. 
This block also allows the villager to restock in non-working hours.
The restocking time of the villager is not dependent on any external sources like day/night time or dimension.
You can customize the trading interval in the config.

## The Auto Trader Block

The auto trader works exactly line the trader block, except it automatically trades items for you.
You can also automatically put items in and take items out with a hopper.
The cooldown between trades is fully configurable.

## The Farmer Block

The farmer block contains a whole crop farm in a single block. This helps to reduce lag and save space.

## The Breeder Block

The breeder block produces baby villagers by putting in food. This also helps to reduce lag, save space and also a lot of frustration.

## The Converter Block

The converter block converts villagers to zombie villagers and cures them afterwards, enabling the player that placed the block better trades from the cured villager. 
This block needs a golden apple, any type of potion of weakness and the villager to convert. 
This process takes approximately five minutes.

## The Iron Farm Block

The iron farm block contains a complete iron farm in a single block. 
It produces one iron golem every four minutes. 
This averages about one iron ingot per minute.

## The Incubator Block

The incubator block increases the growth rate of baby villagers.
The speed can be changed in the config.

## Trade Cycling

When looking for a good trade, you always have to remove the villagers workstation, in order to reset their trades.
The trade cycle button solves this problem. If a villager hasn't been traded before, you can just press it and the trades reset automatically.
Alternatively you can use the `C` key to cycle trades.

This also works for normal villagers.

You can take stuff out of these blocks, by sneaking and right-clicking the block with an empty hand. 

Baby villagers are able to grow up inside of blocks, but the functionality of the blocks will not work until they are grown.

All blocks keep their stuff inside if they are broken.
