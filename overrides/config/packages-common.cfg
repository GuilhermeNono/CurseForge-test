# Allow interacting with Packages in the player inventory, kinda like a bundle.
# Default: true

# Play sounds when players interact with a Package.
# Default: true

# If 'true', the item tags `packages:allowlist_package_maker_frame` and `packages:allowlist_package_maker_inner`
# will be read, and only the items specified in those tags will be allowed to enter the Frame and Core slots of
# the Package Maker. This is mainly for modpackers to mess with; you should also probably add something to the tooltip
# lang keys (`packages.package_maker.frame.X`, where X is a one-indexed line number) to describe the behavior you create.
# Default: false
